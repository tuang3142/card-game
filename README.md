**Rule**: the game starts with one card face up followed by seven cards face down. The player guesses whether the next card to be turned over will be higher or lower than the last visible card by pressing Lower or Higher. The player starts with 100 points, gains 15 points for a correct answer, and loses 10 points for an incorrect answer. When the game is over, the user can click New Game to start a new round of the game.
